## Data Source
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data
Over 1GB from Kaggle's Used Cars Dataset, targeting listing prices.

## Data Introduction
The dataset is a comprehensive collection of used vehicle listings from Craigslist across the United States. It has been compiled by scraping the platform every few months and contains detailed information about the car sales posted there. There are 426880 row, 26 columns and 9443544 non-null entities in the dataset. Here's an overview of the types of information included in the dataset, represented by each column:

id: Unique identifier for the listing.

url: URL of the vehicle listing on Craigslist.

region: Geographic region of the listing.

region_url: Craigslist URL for the region.

price: The listed price of the car

year: Year of the vehicle manufacture.

manufacturer: Vehicle manufacturer.

model: Specific model of the vehicle.

condition: Condition of the vehicle (e.g., new, used, etc.).

cylinders: Number of cylinders in the vehicle's engine.

fuel: Type of fuel the vehicle uses.

odometer: Mileage on the vehicle.

title_status: Legal status of the vehicle's title.

transmission: Type of vehicle transmission.

VIN: Vehicle Identification Number.

drive: Type of drivetrain.

size: Size category of the vehicle.

type: Type of vehicle body.

paint_color: Color of the vehicle.

image_url: URL of the vehicle's image.

description: Description provided in the listing.

county: County where the vehicle is located (often missing).

state: State where the vehicle is listed. lat: Latitude coordinate for the listing location.

long: Longitude coordinate for the listing location.

posting_date: Date and time when the listing was posted.

## Context
Tapping into the vast $138 billion US used car market, this project seeks to refine pricing strategies for sellers and guide buyers.

## Approach
Employing decision trees and random forest models, the project aims to predict accurate car valuations, benefiting both sellers and buyers in the dynamic used car market.

##  Business Question/Task
### Market Analysis and Trend Prediction:

How can machine learning be used to analyze current market trends in used car prices, and predict future trends based on historical data, thereby aiding investors and dealerships in making informed decisions?

### Personalized Price Recommendations:

Can a machine learning model provide personalized price recommendations for individual sellers based on their car's characteristics, location, and current market conditions, to optimize their chances of a successful and profitable sale?

### Dynamic Pricing for Online Platforms:

How can an algorithm dynamically adjust car listing prices on an online platform, based on real-time market data and individual car features, to enhance sales and customer satisfaction?

### Identifying Under- or Overpriced Listings:

Can a predictive model be designed to flag potentially under- or overpriced car listings for further review, helping online marketplaces maintain pricing integrity and protect consumers?
